# TexEtch

TexEtch is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to convert diagrams drawn in [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) into text format. This text format can be easily integrated into your code base to provide better explanations and documentation for your code.<br>

**Just an example**
  <div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
    <img src="/images/Doraemon.png" alt="Doraemon" width="60%">
  </div>

## Features

- **Diagram to Text Conversion**: Convert complex diagrams from draw.io into readable text format.
- **Seamless Integration**: Easily integrate the converted text into your codebase to enhance documentation. Option to put the produced output at the top of the code block or alongside the code block.
- **Support for Multiple Diagram Types**: Handles a variety of diagram types and structures.

## Installation

The extension can be installed from Visual Studio Code Marketplace.

## Usage
1. Open the draw.io website or application and create a file containing your desired diagram.
2. Navigate to File -> Export as -> XML and download the file.

4. Type TexEtch and select the corresponding command.
5. An Open Dialog box will appear, prompting you to select the required .xml file.

- **Circle and Ellipse**
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <img src="/images/Circle.png" alt="Circle" width="25%">
  <img src="/images/Ellipse.png" alt="Ellipse" width="50%">
</div>

- **Text**
    - Use text size as **11** in the draw.io editor to match the exact ratio of figures and text in the final output.
    - Avoid copying text from sources with colorful text to prevent disperancies in the output.
    - Leave enough space on the boundaries of text box, so that text can appear in same format.

- **Rectangle** 

**Caution**
Please don't use arrows which originate directly from figures like shown below:<br>
